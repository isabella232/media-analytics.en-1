# Get Media Playback Time Spent JSON report data with Analytics 2.0 APIs{#get-media-playback-time-spent-json-report-data}

You can obtain media playback time spent report data using the [_*Analytics 2.0 APIs*_](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/analytics/docs.html).

1. Filter the data using any segment that is built on the UI. To filter by a specific Content ID, create a new segment.  
1. Set the `elements` -> `id` in the request body to `metrics/playback_time_spent_seconds` or `metrics/playback_time_spent_minutes` depending on whether you want the output in seconds or minutes.
1. Request a sufficient amount of data.  

    * The data range you specify in the report gathers all concurrent viewer data _at the time the video session ended._
       You must account for sessions that start on one day and end after midnight which is the next day.

    * Request one more day of data to your intended period in your request, but in your analysis _*use only the intended data.*_

A sample request payload for one day of data would look like the following sample. The request is done for 2 consecutive days but in reporting you use only the first day.

## Sample Request
