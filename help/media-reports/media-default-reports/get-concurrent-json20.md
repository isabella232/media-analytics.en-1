# Get Concurrent Viewers JSON report data with Analytics 2.0 APIs{#get-concurrent-viewers-json-report-data}

You can obtain concurrent viewers report data using the [_*Analytics 2.0 APIs*_](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/analytics/docs.html).

1. Filter the data using any segment that is built on the UI. To filter by a specific Content ID, create a new segment.  
1. Set the `elements` -> `id` in the request body to `metrics/concurrent_viewers_visitors`.
1. Request a sufficient amount of data.  

    * The data range you specify in the report gathers all concurrent viewer data _at the time the video session ended._
       You must account for sessions that start on one day and end after midnight which is the next day.

    * Request one more day of data to your intended period in your request, but in your analysis _*use only the intended data.*_

A sample request payload for one day of data would look like the following sample. The request is done for 2 consecutive days but in reporting you use only the first day.

## Sample Request

```json
{
    "rsid": "[YOUR_RSID]",
    "locale": "en_US",
    "dimension": "variables/daterangeminute",
    "globalFilters": [

        }

            }

              "dateTo": "2017-09-07",

                      "id": "instances"
                  }
              ],
              "elements": [
                  {
                      "id": "videoconcurrentviewers",
                      "top": 2880

      }

      ```

      >[!TIP]
      >
      >Some sessions are ended on the next day, and at that point the data will be available for reporting. In that case the best approach is to select 2 days (2880 minutes) of data, and use only the data for the first day (1440 minutes).
