## Media Concurrent Viewers Panel in Analysis Workspace

## Get Concurrent Viewers via Analytics Reporting API

You can also get concurrent viewer data for up to 1-month at a time at minute-level granularity using the Analytics Reporting API 2.0.  The reporting API uses the same definition of concurrent viewers as Analysis Workspace.  For more information see [_*Get concurrent viewers JSON report data with Analytics 2.0 APIs*_](/help/media-reports/media-default-reports/get-concurrent-json20.md).
